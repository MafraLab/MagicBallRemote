Arduino based ir Remote to control a magicball

In our hackerspace a volunteer has offered us a MagicBall!
A MagicBall is gadget that has a spherical form and that contains a POV system inside to display information inside.

This device can only be programmed with a IR remote that is... let's say... quite expensive so we tried to hack the signal
to emulate a remote control... 

You can see the scheme (that is very simple) on this link: http://123d.circuits.io/circuits/108055-irmagicball
