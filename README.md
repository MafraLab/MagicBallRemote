Arduino based ir Remote to control a magicball

In our hackerspace a volunteer has offered us a MagicBall!
A MagicBall is gadget that has a spherical form and that contains a POV system inside to display information inside.

This device can only be programmed with a IR remote that is... let's say... quite expensive so we tried to hack the signal
to emulate a remote control... 

Take a look at our github page for more details: http://mafralab.github.io/MagicBallRemote/
